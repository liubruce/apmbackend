enterpriseinfo.flows-desc = A flow visualization is a graphic that a traces a route or a path. With Flows, it's possible to see the steps users take to reach each page, or each event, depending on whether you track web pages or mobile apps. You can apply any filter like device, city, country, local hour, carrier and more. Each bubble can represent number of sessions or number of users. Since it's possible to segment with campaign, it's possible how traffic is engaging with your content and look for especially overperforming or underperforming campaigns or sources.
